# Classification

When we have to predict a category or class, we use Classification
When we have to predict a number or numerical data, we use Regression


    - Binary Classification
            Two Classes
            e.g True/False Pass/Fail Horse/Donkey
            
    - Multi Classification
            More than two classes
            e.g Apple/Orange/Peach
            
    - Multi Class Classification

We will study these models under classification

    - Logistic Regression (despite the name, it's for classification)
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Neural Networks for classification
